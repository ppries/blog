I'm currently employed as a machine learning researcher at
[Veo](http://www.veo.co) in Copenhagen. More info in my
[CV]({{ site.baseurl }}assets/pdfs/cv.pdf).

This site is primarily a platform for learning for me. As I finish projects at
completely irregular intervals, I will post somewhat polished pieces of code as
well as my learnings and thoughts through the process. I find that the best way
to ensure you've learned a subject to satisfaction is to attempt teaching
it – even if it is to a virtual (and, to be realistic, non-existant) audience.

The areas covered will mainly be from machine learning, more specifically deep
learning – but I hope to explore other areas as well.
